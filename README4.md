# Customer Segmentation Project

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation using the **Mall Customers dataset**.  
The goal is to analyze customer behavior and group them into meaningful clusters that can help businesses understand their customers better.

## 🛠 Steps Taken
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values and performed basic preprocessing.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized customer distribution and spending patterns.
- **Clustering:**
  - Applied **KMeans** to segment customers into groups.
  - Applied **DBSCAN** to detect density-based clusters and outliers.
- **Visualization:** Used plots to interpret and compare clustering results.

## 📊 Insights
- KMeans revealed distinct customer groups based on spending and income levels.
- DBSCAN identified noise points and clusters not captured by KMeans.
- These insights can be used for targeted marketing strategies and customer profiling.

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- scikit-learn (KMeans, DBSCAN)
